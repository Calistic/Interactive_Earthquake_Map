- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data. Tool: JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library

- Add multiple map layers to maps. Tool: Leaflet control plugins

- Add legend control and layer control as well as popup circleMarker based on magnitude level. Tool: Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.

- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
